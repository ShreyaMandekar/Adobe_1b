1. Overview
This document outlines the methodology behind the generic_document_analyzer.py script. The script's primary goal is to automate the analysis of a collection of PDF documents to identify and rank the most relevant sections based on a defined user persona and a specific "job to be done."

The process can be summarized in four main stages:

Configuration & Input: Setting up the environment and loading the analysis parameters.

Section Extraction: Parsing PDF documents to intelligently identify and extract logical sections based on visual formatting cues.

Relevance Analysis & Ranking: Filtering the extracted sections against hard constraints and then ranking the compliant sections based on their semantic relevance to the user's task.

Output Generation: Formatting the results into a structured JSON file containing the top-ranked sections and their content.

2. Core Components & Workflow
The script is built around two main classes, PDFSectionExtractor and RelevanceAnalyzer, which are orchestrated by the run_pipeline function.

Step 1: PDF Section Extraction (PDFSectionExtractor)
This class is responsible for the structural analysis of the PDF files. Instead of treating the PDF as a single block of text, it attempts to reconstruct the document's intended structure.

Methodology:

Dominant Font Analysis: For each page, the script first determines the most common font size and family. This establishes a baseline for what constitutes "body text."

Title Identification (_is_title): The script iterates through all text blocks on a page. A block is identified as a potential "title" if it meets the following criteria:

It is relatively short (1-2 lines, under 10 words).

Its font size is noticeably larger than the page's dominant font size.

Its font style is distinct (e.g., it is bold while the dominant font is not).

Content Aggregation: When a title is identified, a new section is created. All subsequent text blocks are appended as content to this section until another title is found. This process continues through the entire document, effectively grouping content under its most likely heading.

Cleaning: Finally, all extracted content is cleaned to remove excessive whitespace, ensuring a clean text corpus for the next stage.

Step 2: Relevance Analysis & Ranking (RelevanceAnalyzer)
This class takes the raw, structured sections from the extractor and performs the core analysis to find the most useful information.

Methodology:

Semantic Understanding: The analyzer uses the sentence-transformers library (specifically the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model). This model converts text into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning, allowing the script to understand context and relevance beyond simple keyword matching.

Constraint Filtering (_is_compliant): Before any ranking occurs, the sections are first filtered based on the hard constraints defined in the challenge1b_input.json file.

exclude_keywords: Any section containing these keywords is immediately discarded.

include_keywords: If this list is provided, only sections that contain at least one of these keywords are kept.

This filtering is done using regular expressions to ensure only whole words are matched, preventing partial matches (e.g., avoiding matching "test" in "latest").

Semantic Ranking (rank_sections):

Focus Query: A target query is constructed by combining the user persona and the job_to_be_done task (e.g., "Data Scientist: Understand the methodology for data processing"). This query represents the user's core intent.

Embedding: Both the focus query and all the compliant sections are converted into numerical vector embeddings using the sentence transformer model.

Cosine Similarity: The script calculates the cosine similarity between the focus query's vector and each section's vector. This score, ranging from -1 to 1, measures the semantic similarity between the user's intent and the content of a section. A higher score means a closer match.

Sorting: The sections are then sorted in descending order based on their cosine similarity score. The highest-scoring sections are the most relevant.

Step 3: Orchestration and Output (run_pipeline)
This function manages the entire end-to-end process.

Workflow:

Load Inputs: It reads the COLLECTION_FOLDER_NAME and loads the corresponding challenge1b_input.json file.

Extract: It iterates through the list of PDF documents provided in the input JSON, calling PDFSectionExtractor on each one to gather all sections from all documents into a single list.

Analyze: It passes this comprehensive list of sections to the RelevanceAnalyzer to perform the filtering and ranking, yielding a single, prioritized list of the most relevant sections across the entire document collection.

Generate Output:

It selects the top 5 highest-ranked sections.

It creates two primary lists for the output JSON:

extracted_sections: A summary of the top sections, including their document source, title, rank, and page number.

subsection_analysis: The full, cleaned text content (refined_text) of these top sections.

It wraps this data with metadata about the analysis run.

Save Results: The final structured data is written to challenge1b_output.json in the same directory.

3. Key Assumptions
Structural Formatting: The script assumes that section titles in the PDFs are visually distinct from body text (i.e., they are larger, bolder, or use a different font).

Semantic Relevance: The approach relies on the idea that the semantic similarity between a user's stated goal and a section's text is a strong indicator of that section's usefulness.

Self-Contained Sections: It assumes that the content under a heading is largely self-contained and relevant to that heading.
